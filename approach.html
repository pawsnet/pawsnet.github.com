        <p><strong>PAWS Approach</strong></p>
        <p>Our research is informing and developing technology to enable
          free Internet connectivity to access essential services,
          paving the way to new access models. PAWS (Public Access WiFi
          Service), is a new Internet access paradigm based on a set of
          techniques that make use of the available unused capacity in
          home broadband networks and allowing Less-than-Best Effort
          (LBE) access to these resources. Case study deployment of this
          technology will be underpinned by a programme of social
          research which will establish a socio-economic profile of the
          area, recruit potential participants and, most importantly,
          conduct a longitudinal multi-method assessment of
          participants’ current practices and subsequent experiences of
          this technology.<br>

          PAWS adopts an approach of community-wide participation, where
          broadband customers are enabled to donate controlled but free
          use of their high-speed broadband Internet by fellow citizens.
          Other initiatives have already explored sharing a user’s
          broadband Internet connection via wireless (e.g. BT FON).
          Although these methods are gaining worldwide acceptance, they
          are usually viewed as an extension of a user’s paid service –
          accessible only to other customers of the same service. In
          contrast, PAWS will extend support free access to essential
          services to all. To protect the consumer’s paid service and
          the service provider revenue, it is essential to ensure that
          the free user traffic does not impact perceived performance of
          the bandwidth donor (customer). The PAWS service is therefore
          constrained to offer a LBE access to network resources (lower
          quality compared to the standard Internet service offered to
          paying users). Various methods are being considered, including
          enabling LBE in the network. </p>
        <p>The project is designed to consider the recent growth of
          smartphones, as the user interface to many digital
          applications, and to a lesser degree other common WiFi enabled
          devices like tablets, laptops and TVs, that the digitally
          excluded are beginning to access the Internet. Data is limited
          on this recent phenomenon but it is known that 52% of 16-24
          year olds and 23% of Socio-Economic Group C2DE now have
          smartphones. This proportion is growing rapidly: in both
          groups, 65% obtained their phone in the last 12 months. This
          growth is likely driven at least in part by the willingness of
          parents in low income families to make considerable sacrifices
          to meet their children’s informational needs. WiFi-enabled
          Pay-As-You-Go smartphones are now available for £50 and as
          prices continue to fall it is likely that an increasing
          proportion of the 86% of C2DE individuals who already own a
          mobile will switch to a smartphone. PAWS would further
          accelerate uptake by providing a free, network-independent
          means of Internet communication.</p>
