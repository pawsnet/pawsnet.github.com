# PAWS <small>Public Access Wi-Fi Service</small>

PAWS (Public Access WiFi Service) is a RCUK funded project that seeks to develop technology that will enable a service provider to offer free Internet connectivity to access essential services to all. This will provide greater opportunities of access, enabling digital inclusion and, in turn supporting the UK Government's 'digital by default' programme with associated cost savings.

This project is funded by the EPSRC. The project has several partners: Horizon Digital Economy Research Institute, Rural Digital Economy Hub (funded through its partnership fund), BT, SamKnows, Nottingham City Council and the Highlands and Islands Enterprise.
