        <p><strong>Problem Statement</strong></p>
        <p>Digital inclusion is important for social equality to ensure
          access to the many benefits the Internet offers. These
          benefits include access to support services and information,
          cheaper goods, and online communities; and as novel services
          continue to become available (i.e. the Internet of Things) the
          consequences of exclusion will continue to grow. The digitally
          excluded are often elderly, socially excluded, and/or
          economically deprived. These individuals commonly have low
          levels of physical mobility (e.g. lack a car) and high levels
          of reliance on support services, and so have a great deal to
          gain from Internet access. At the societal level, aside from
          issues of social justice and equality, the consequences of
          digital exclusion are economically inefficient offline access
          to services and a reduction in participation in the Digital
          Economy (DE).</p>
        <p>Whilst amongst the elderly the primary exclusionary factor is
          cultural (commonly that they do not perceive value in it),
          amongst younger demographics who want to be online,
          affordability is cited as the primary barrier, explicitly so
          by over 40% of digitally excluded 16-44 year olds. The UK
          Government’s current efforts to address digital inclusion have
          focused primarily on allocation of £530m to subsidise industry
          deployment of both ‘superfast’ broadband to urban areas, and
          ‘standard’ broadband to more remote locations. This approach
          is predicated on a desire to support novel DE services through
          improvements in speed for urban users, while simultaneously
          ensuring basic levels of access for all (e.g. access to
          critical services such as jobseekers, NHSonline websites etc
          which do not require high capacity broadband) .</p>
        <p>Crucially, this approach addresses infrastructural barriers
          without addressing economic ones. Pricing is left to the
          market. However we believe that leaving connectivity for all
          to be governed by market economics is a major impediment to
          achieving the full benefits of a DE, and that basic Internet
          access should be made freely available to all due to its
          societal benefits, a sentiment recently expressed by
          Berners-Lee. Many individuals find themselves unable to afford
          broadband access, unable to pass a necessary credit check, or
          living in circumstances that are too unstable to commit to
          lengthy broadband contracts. Indeed, Internet services are
          increasingly accessed on the move and so current models of
          “roaming” access provision drive this economic exclusion to a
          new level, not currently addressed by the push to deploy
          broadband.</p>
        <p>Although there is no single ‘magic bullet’ to remove
          socio-economic barriers, there are infrastructural solutions
          that could drastically reduce them. The Public Access WiFi
          Service (PAWS) project is a first step in this direction: a
          feasibility study to establish technical requirements and
          identify the current practices and needs of the digitally
          excluded. Following successful demonstration, we hope that
          government policy can be nudged to support industry uptake
          leading to national deployment.</p>
        <p><strong>PAWS Approach</strong></p>
        <p>Our research is informing and developing technology to enable
          free Internet connectivity to access essential services,
          paving the way to new access models. PAWS (Public Access WiFi
          Service), is a new Internet access paradigm based on a set of
          techniques that make use of the available unused capacity in
          home broadband networks and allowing Less-than-Best Effort
          (LBE) access to these resources. Case study deployment of this
          technology will be underpinned by a programme of social
          research which will establish a socio-economic profile of the
          area, recruit potential participants and, most importantly,
          conduct a longitudinal multi-method assessment of
          participants’ current practices and subsequent experiences of
          this technology.<br>

          PAWS adopts an approach of community-wide participation, where
          broadband customers are enabled to donate controlled but free
          use of their high-speed broadband Internet by fellow citizens.
          Other initiatives have already explored sharing a user’s
          broadband Internet connection via wireless (e.g. BT FON).
          Although these methods are gaining worldwide acceptance, they
          are usually viewed as an extension of a user’s paid service –
          accessible only to other customers of the same service. In
          contrast, PAWS will extend support free access to essential
          services to all. To protect the consumer’s paid service and
          the service provider revenue, it is essential to ensure that
          the free user traffic does not impact perceived performance of
          the bandwidth donor (customer). The PAWS service is therefore
          constrained to offer a LBE access to network resources (lower
          quality compared to the standard Internet service offered to
          paying users). Various methods are being considered, including
          enabling LBE in the network. </p>
        <p>The project is designed to consider the recent growth of
          smartphones, as the user interface to many digital
          applications, and to a lesser degree other common WiFi enabled
          devices like tablets, laptops and TVs, that the digitally
          excluded are beginning to access the Internet. Data is limited
          on this recent phenomenon but it is known that 52% of 16-24
          year olds and 23% of Socio-Economic Group C2DE now have
          smartphones. This proportion is growing rapidly: in both
          groups, 65% obtained their phone in the last 12 months. This
          growth is likely driven at least in part by the willingness of
          parents in low income families to make considerable sacrifices
          to meet their children’s informational needs. WiFi-enabled
          Pay-As-You-Go smartphones are now available for £50 and as
          prices continue to fall it is likely that an increasing
          proportion of the 86% of C2DE individuals who already own a
          mobile will switch to a smartphone. PAWS would further
          accelerate uptake by providing a free, network-independent
          means of Internet communication.</p>
        <p><strong>User Engagement in PAWS</strong></p>
        <p>The project seeks to increase user access opportunities,
          enabling digital inclusion and in turn supporting the UK
          Government’s ‘digital by default’ programme with its
          associated cost savings and service improvements. We will
          explore the benefits offered by our proposed method to both
          users and network operators. This will consider other
          important deployment challenges concerning how to manage a
          “free user base”, e.g. establishing a fair use policy, access
          control, etc. </p>
        <p>Case study deployment of the technology to both urban and
          rural deployment areas will underpin the programme of
          research. The project will recruit 50 ‘donors’ (existing
          broadband users whose routers will provide access points) and
          50 ‘users’ (currently digitally excluded) in each deployment
          area. </p>
        <p>The research programme has two strands: socio-economic and
          technological: </p>
        <p>(a) Socio-Economic: The socio-economic strand will establish
          a picture of relevant urban-rural economic demographics i.e.
          people who cannot afford to pay for a basic/high speed
          Internet service; to understand ownership of devices that have
          the capability to access services, and the user requirements;
          to evaluate perceptions of the opportunities offered, and
          ultimately the impact of the project itself. We expect the
          majority of users will already own a device to access the
          Internet, but we will also provide 10 users with smartphones
          during the trial, which will provide additional usage
          information.</p>
        <p>(b) Technology: The technology strand focuses on analysing
          the technologies required for deployment. We seek to
          understand the potential networking techniques in the context
          of how broadband customers use their Internet service and how
          much unused capacity is actually available within the network.
          We seek to answer the following high-level questions: How easy
          is it for an operator (e.g. BT, a project partner) to deploy a
          LBE service and make it known to potential users? What
          facilities must we provide regarding registration of users to
          such a service for regulatory, legal and other reasons (e.g.
          lawful interception)?</p>
        <p>Coordination as the deployment proceeds between the two
          strands is expected to allow for the rapid identification of
          social and technical issues, which will then be addressed
          through responsive implementation. We expect the longer term
          goals of the work to influence standardization, define best
          current practice for operators, and influence government
          policy. There could also be opportunities to pilot new
          applications and uses of digital technology.</p>
