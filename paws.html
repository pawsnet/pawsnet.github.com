          <p><b><font face="Georgia">Problem Statement<br>
              </font></b></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Georgia">Digital inclusion is
              important for social equality to ensure access to the many
              benefits the Internet offers. These benefits include
              access to support services and information, cheaper goods,
              and online communities; and as novel services continue to
              become available (i.e. the Internet of Things) the
              consequences of exclusion will continue to grow. The
              digitally excluded are often elderly, socially excluded,
              and/or economically deprived. These individuals commonly
              have low levels of physical mobility (e.g. lack a car) and
              high levels of reliance on support services, and so have a
              great deal to gain from Internet access. At the societal
              level, aside from issues of social justice and equality,
              the consequences of digital exclusion are economically
              inefficient offline access to services and a reduction in
              participation in the Digital Economy (DE). </font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Georgia">Whilst amongst the
              elderly the primary exclusionary factor is cultural
              (commonly that they do not perceive value in it), amongst
              younger demographics who want to be online, affordability
              is cited as the primary barrier, explicitly so by over 40%
              of digitally excluded 16-44 year olds. The UK Government&#8217;s
              current efforts to address digital inclusion have focused
              primarily on allocation of &pound;530m to subsidise
              industry deployment of both &#8216;superfast&#8217; broadband to urban
              areas, and &#8216;standard&#8217; broadband to more remote locations.
              This approach is predicated on a desire to support novel
              DE services through improvements in speed for urban users,
              while simultaneously ensuring basic levels of access for
              all (e.g. access to critical services such as jobseekers,
              NHSonline websites etc which do not require high capacity
              broadband) . </font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Georgia">Crucially, this
              approach addresses infrastructural barriers without
              addressing economic ones. Pricing is left to the market.
              However we believe that leaving connectivity for all to be
              governed by market economics is a major impediment to
              achieving the full benefits of a DE, and that basic
              Internet access should be made freely available to all due
              to its societal benefits, a sentiment recently expressed
              by Berners-Lee. Many individuals find themselves unable to
              afford broadband access, unable to pass a necessary credit
              check, or living in circumstances that are too unstable to
              commit to lengthy broadband contracts. Indeed, Internet
              services are increasingly accessed on the move and so
              current models of &#8220;roaming&#8221; access provision drive this
              economic exclusion to a new level, not currently addressed
              by the push to deploy broadband. </font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Georgia">Although there is no
              single &#8216;magic bullet&#8217; to remove socio-economic barriers,
              there are infrastructural solutions that could drastically
              reduce them. The Public Access WiFi Service (PAWS) project
              is a first step in this direction: a feasibility study to
              establish technical requirements and identify the current
              practices and needs of the digitally excluded. Following
              successful demonstration, we hope that government policy
              can be nudged to support industry uptake leading to
              national deployment.<br>

              <br>
              <font face="Georgia">PAWS adopts an approach of
                community-wide participation, where broadband customers
                are enabled to donate controlled but free use of their
                high-speed broadband Internet by fellow
                citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other initiatives have already
                explored sharing a user&#8217;s broadband Internet connection
                via wireless (e.g. BT FON). Although these methods&nbsp;
                are gaining worldwide acceptance, they are usually
                viewed as an extension of a user&#8217;s paid service &#8211;
                accessible only to other customers of the same service.
                In contrast, PAWS will extend support free access to
                essential services to all. </font><font face="Georgia">To

                protect the consumer&#8217;s paid service and the service
                provider revenue, it is essential to ensure that the
                free user traffic does not impact perceived performance
                of the bandwidth donor (customer). The PAWS service is
                therefore constrained to offer a&nbsp; LBE access to
                network resources (lower quality compared to the
                standard Internet service offered to&nbsp; paying
                users).&nbsp; Various methods are </font><font
                face="Georgia">being considered, including enabling LBE
                in the network. </font><br>
              <br>
              <font face="Georgia">The project is designed&nbsp; to
                consider the recent growth of smartphones, as&nbsp; the
                user interface to many digital applications, and to a
                lesser degree other common WiFi enabled devices like
                tablets, laptops and TVs, that the digitally excluded
                are beginning to access the Internet. Data is limited on
                this recent phenomenon but it is known that 52% of 16-24
                year olds and 23% of Socio-Economic Group C2DE now have
                smartphones. This proportion is&nbsp; growing rapidly:
                in both groups,&nbsp; 65% obtained their phone in the
                last 12 months. This growth is likely driven at least in
              </font><font face="Georgia">part by the willingness of
                parents in low income families to make considerable
                sacrifices to meet&nbsp; their children&#8217;s informational
                needs. WiFi-enabled Pay-As-You-Go smartphones are now
                available for &pound;50 and as prices continue to fall
                it is likely that an increasing proportion of the 86% of
                C2DE individuals who already own a mobile will switch to
                a smartphone. PAWS would further accelerate uptake by
                providing a free, network-independent means of Internet
                communication.</font><br>

                access opportunities, enabling digital inclusion and in
                turn supporting the UK Government&#8217;s &#8216;digital by default&#8217;
                programme with its associated&nbsp; cost savings and
                service improvements. We will explore the benefits
                offered by our proposed method to both users and network
                operators. This will consider other important deployment
                challenges concerning how to manage a &#8220;free user base&#8221;,
                e.g. establishing a fair use policy, access control,
                etc. </font><br>

              <font face="Georgia">Case study deployment of the
                technology to both urban and rural deployment areas will
                underpin the programme of research.&nbsp; The project
                will recruit 50 &#8216;donors&#8217; (existing broadband users whose
                routers will provide access points) and 50 &#8216;users&#8217;
                (currently digitally excluded) in each deployment area.
              </font><br>
              <br>
              <font face="Georgia">The research programme has two
                strands: socio-economic and technological: </font><br>
              <br>
              <font face="Georgia">(a) Socio-Economic: The
                socio-economic strand&nbsp; will establish a picture of
                relevant urban-rural economic demographics i.e. people
                who cannot afford to pay for a basic/high speed Internet
                service; to understand ownership of devices that have
                the capability to access services, and the user
                requirements; to evaluate perceptions of the
                opportunities offered, and ultimately the impact of the
                project itself. We expect the majority of users will
                already own a device to access the Internet, but we will
                also provide 10 users with smartphones during the trial,
                which will provide additional usage information.</font><br>
              <br>
              <font face="Georgia">(b) Technology:&nbsp; The technology
                strand focuses on analysing the technologies required
                for deployment. We seek to understand the potential
                networking techniques in the context of how broadband
                customers use their Internet service and how much unused
                capacity is actually available within the network. We
                seek to answer the following high-level questions: How
                easy is it for an operator (e.g. BT, a project partner)
                to deploy a LBE service and make it known to potential
                users? What facilities must we provide regarding
                registration of users to such a service for regulatory,
                legal and other reasons (e.g. lawful interception)?</font><br>
              <br>
              <font face="Georgia">Coordination as the deployment
                proceeds between the two strands is expected to allow
                for the rapid identification of social and technical
                issues, which will then be addressed through responsive
                implementation. We expect the longer term goals of the
                work to influence standardization, define best current
                practice for operators, and influence government policy.
                There could also be opportunities to pilot new
                applications and uses of digital technology.</font><br>
