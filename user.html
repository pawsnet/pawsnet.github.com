      <section><strong>User Engagement in PAWS<br>
          <br>
        </strong>
        <p>The project seeks to increase user access opportunities,
          enabling digital inclusion and in turn supporting the UK
          Government’s ‘digital by default’ programme with its
          associated cost savings and service improvements. We will
          explore the benefits offered by our proposed method to both
          users and network operators. This will consider other
          important deployment challenges concerning how to manage a
          “free user base”, e.g. establishing a fair use policy, access
          control, etc. </p>
        <p>Case study deployment of the technology to both urban and
          rural deployment areas will underpin the programme of
          research. The project will recruit 50 ‘donors’ (existing
          broadband users whose routers will provide access points) and
          50 ‘users’ (currently digitally excluded) in each deployment
          area. </p>
        <p>The research programme has two strands: socio-economic and
          technological: </p>
        <p>(a) Socio-Economic: The socio-economic strand will establish
          a picture of relevant urban-rural economic demographics i.e.
          people who cannot afford to pay for a basic/high speed
          Internet service; to understand ownership of devices that have
          the capability to access services, and the user requirements;
          to evaluate perceptions of the opportunities offered, and
          ultimately the impact of the project itself. We expect the
          majority of users will already own a device to access the
          Internet, but we will also provide 10 users with smartphones
          during the trial, which will provide additional usage
          information.</p>
        <p>(b) Technology: The technology strand focuses on analysing
          the technologies required for deployment. We seek to
          understand the potential networking techniques in the context
          of how broadband customers use their Internet service and how
          much unused capacity is actually available within the network.
          We seek to answer the following high-level questions: How easy
          is it for an operator (e.g. BT, a project partner) to deploy a
          LBE service and make it known to potential users? What
          facilities must we provide regarding registration of users to
          such a service for regulatory, legal and other reasons (e.g.
          lawful interception)?</p>
        <p>Coordination as the deployment proceeds between the two
          strands is expected to allow for the rapid identification of
          social and technical issues, which will then be addressed
          through responsive implementation. We expect the longer term
          goals of the work to influence standardization, define best
          current practice for operators, and influence government
          policy. There could also be opportunities to pilot new
          applications and uses of digital technology.<br>
