# PAWS Approach

Our research is informing and developing technology to enable free Internet connectivity to access essential services, paving the way to new access models. PAWS (Public Access WiFi Service), is a new Internet access paradigm based on a set of techniques that make use of the available unused capacity in home broadband networks and allowing Less-than-Best Effort (LBE) access to these resources. Case study deployment of this technology will be underpinned by a programme of social research which will establish a socio-economic profile of the area, recruit potential participants and, most importantly, conduct a longitudinal multi-method assessment of participants' current practices and subsequent experiences of this technology.

PAWS adopts an approach of community-wide participation, where broadband customers are enabled to donate controlled but free use of their high-speed broadband Internet by fellow citizens. Other initiatives have already explored sharing a user's broadband Internet connection via wireless (e.g. BT FON). Although these methods are gaining worldwide acceptance, they are usually viewed as an extension of a user's paid service -- accessible only to other customers of the same service. In contrast, PAWS will extend support free access to essential services to all. To protect the consumer's paid service and the service provider revenue, it is essential to ensure that the free user traffic does not impact perceived performance of the bandwidth donor (customer). The PAWS service is therefore constrained to offer a LBE access to network resources (lower quality compared to the standard Internet service offered to paying users). Various methods are being considered, including enabling LBE in the network.
          
The project is designed to consider the recent growth of smartphones, as the user interface to many digital applications, and to a lesser degree other common WiFi enabled devices like tablets, laptops and TVs, that the digitally excluded are beginning to access the Internet. Data is limited on this recent phenomenon but it is known that 52% of 16-24 year olds and 23% of Socio-Economic Group C2DE now have smartphones. This proportion is growing rapidly: in both groups, 65% obtained their phone in the last 12 months. This growth is likely driven at least in part by the willingness of parents in low income families to make considerable sacrifices to meet their children's informational needs. WiFi-enabled Pay-As-You-Go smartphones are now available for Â£50 and as prices continue to fall it is likely that an increasing proportion of the 86% of C2DE individuals who already own a mobile will switch to a smartphone. PAWS would further accelerate uptake by providing a free, network-independent means of Internet communication.
