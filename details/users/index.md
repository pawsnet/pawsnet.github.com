# User Engagement

The project seeks to increase user access opportunities, enabling digital inclusion and in turn supporting the UK Government’s ‘digital by default’ programme with its associated cost savings and service improvements. We will explore the benefits offered by our proposed method to both users and network operators. This will consider other important deployment challenges concerning how to manage a “free user base”, e.g. establishing a fair use policy, access control, etc.

Case study deployment of the technology to both urban and rural deployment areas will underpin the programme of research. The project will recruit 50 ‘donors’ (existing broadband users whose routers will provide access points) and 50 ‘users’ (currently digitally excluded) in each deployment area.

The research programme has two strands: socio-economic and technological:

1. Socio-Economic: The socio-economic strand will establish a picture of relevant urban-rural economic demographics i.e. people who cannot afford to pay for a basic/high speed Internet service; to understand ownership of devices that have the capability to access services, and the user requirements; to evaluate perceptions of the opportunities offered, and ultimately the impact of the project itself. We expect the majority of users will already own a device to access the Internet, but we will also provide 10 users with smartphones during the trial, which will provide additional usage information.

2. Technology: The technology strand focuses on analysing the technologies required for deployment. We seek to understand the potential networking techniques in the context of how broadband customers use their Internet service and how much unused capacity is actually available within the network. We seek to answer the following high-level questions: How easy is it for an operator (e.g. BT) to deploy a LBE service and make it known to potential users? What facilities must we provide regarding registration of users to such a service for regulatory, legal and other reasons (e.g. lawful interception)?

Coordination as the deployment proceeds between the two strands is expected to allow for the rapid identification of social and technical issues, which will then be addressed through responsive implementation. We expect the longer term goals of the work to influence standardization, define best current practice for operators, and influence government policy. There could also be opportunities to pilot new applications and uses of digital technology.<br>
